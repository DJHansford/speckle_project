# speckle_simulate_unedited
This is the original code I used to simulate optical propagation of coherent laser light through a dynamic Liquid Crystal diffuser, through a lens, off a paper screen and imaged by a camera. This is not very well commented (as I was writing this while writing my thesis!) and may be difficult to follow. A full write-up of how the code works is found in Chapter 7 of my thesis.

I started editing the code to be easier to follow and the parts I completed are found in the folder speckle_simulate

## Code that has been rewritten
`run_all_steve` is now `run_lc_to_camera`  
`steve_2_2` is now `prop_lc_to_camera`
`cumulative_sc_old` is now `cumulative_sc`
`findfolderswith` has the same name
