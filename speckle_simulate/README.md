# speckle_simulate
This code simulates optical propagation of coherent laser light through a dynamic Liquid Crystal diffuser, through a lens, off a paper screen and imaged by a camera.

## run_lc_to_camera
`run_lc_to_camera`  
Sets up for simulation of light propagation from the LC device through a lens, onto a screen and then imaged by a camera. You will be prompted to provide the location of your simulated data and your screen selection. (Two screens that I used in my DPhil are provided in \supplementary\screens).
